# Stoic Identity

Stoic Identity is an ICP Identity that works directly with the @dfinity/agent for signing canister messages using your StoicWallet.com account. Stoic Identity allows 3rd party dapps to connect to your wallet using a local-only bridge. Applications must request authorization to connect to your wallet, and can only access your wallet on your local PC with the web-wallet unlocked.

3rd party developers are not granted direct remote access - only local, and you can revoke local access directly from the StoicWallet app. **Your private keys are not exposed, but if you authorize your wallet with an application than that application can sign any canister message on your behalf.**

In future, we will add **canister scopes** to authorization requests, so applications must define which canister ID's they will use with their application.

## Installation

```
npm i ic-stoic-identity --save-dev
```

### In the browser:

```javascript
import {StoicIdentity} from 'ic-stoic-identity';
```

Usage:

```javascript
StoicIdentity.load().then(async (identity) => {
    if (identity !== false) {
        //ID is a already connected wallet!
    } else {
        //No existing connection, lets make one!
        identity = await StoicIdentity.connect();
    }

    //Lets display the connected principal!
    console.log(identity.getPrincipal().toText());

    //Create an actor canister
    const actor = Actor.createActor(idlFactory, {
        agent: new HttpAgent({
            identity,
        }),
        canisterId,
    });

    //Disconnect after
    StoicIdentity.disconnect();
});
